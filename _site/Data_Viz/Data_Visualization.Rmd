# Data Viz Makeover objectives

Critics and remake of a particular data visualization 
*This was written as part of the requirements for ISSS608 Visual Analytics module of SMU's Master of IT in Business Program*

## **1.0 Original Data Visualization**
![](D:/chentaoliu01/ISSS608/VA/_site/Data_Viz/Original Viz.png) 

## **2.0 Data Source** 
The data visualization above is created by using data provided by Singapore Minstry of Manpower(MOM). The data can be retrieve from the here [https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/LabourForceTimeSeries.aspx].

## **3.0 Critics**

## 3.1 Evaluation criteria (clarity)

### 3.11 Vague visualization Header 
The header fails to include the groups which the data is organized into.  
The header fails to indicate the data collection period.  

### 3.12 Meaningless visualization header
The header is not translating the message of the graph.    

### 3.13 Improper labeling of y-axis
The y-axis is showing an abbreviation of "Lfpr" which the reader will not be able to understand. The number shown on y-axis is also missing units.     

### 3.14 Misleading naming of the age groups
The phrase "70 & Over" implies that this age group covers people age 70 and above which includes the other age group which is "75 & Over".    

### 3.15 Misleading arrangements of age groups 
Different age groups are put at random places so that the bars can be seen with ascending heights.
The result is entertaining but can create a illusion of an steady increase in participating rates.

## 3.2 Evaluation criteria (aesthetics)

### 3.21 Noisy Colors
Colors are too vibrant distracting readers' attention from the data itself.
Coloring different age groups differently is also meaningless since all age groups are in the span of five years.

### 3.22 Crowded x-axis labels
The bottom x-axis label is showing multiple year, looking crowded.

### 3.23 Messy legends
Legends are in random orders, making readers very hard to follow.

## **4.0 Alternative Graphical Representations Suggestions** 

## 4.1 Evaluation criteria (clarity)

### 4.11 Vague visualization Header 
The header should include the the words "Age" & "Sex" which the data is organized by.
The header should include the time period of "1991-2021".

### 4.12 Meaningful visualization header
The header should include a subtitle underneath the header to translate the message of the graph.    

### 4.13 Proper labeling of y-axis
The y-axis should expand on the abbreviation and write "labor force participation rate (%)".

### 4.14 Misleading naming of the age groups
The phrase "70 & Over" should be removed.

### 4.15 Misleading arrangements of age groups 
The bar should be arranged in ascending order from youngest age group to oldest age group.

## 4.2 Evaluation criteria (aesthetics)

### 4.21 "Noisy" Color
Colors should correspond to different meanings. Males could be labeled blue and females could be labeled red.
Age group should either have no colors or less vibrant colors

### 4.22 Labels should be simple and straightforward
The bottom x-axis label should have only one year or can be deleted completely.

### 4.23 Messy legends
Legends should be neatly organized from youngest to oldest (Age Group) so readers can easily follow.

## **5.0 Alternative Graphical Representations Sketch**
![](D:/chentaoliu01/ISSS608/VA/_site/Data_Viz/Screenshot/Draft.jpg) 

Main issues to overcome:

### 5.1 This sketch is mainly designed to address the issue of "Misleading arrangement of Age Group"
By arranging Age Groups from left to right (from youngest age group to oldest age group) and divided up by the 1991-2021 period, the designed visualization should reveal insights regarding change of participation rate within each age group over the 10 year period of time.

### 5.2 This sketch also attempts to reveal trends among residents of different sex 
By adding a second line chart, this visualization can reveal if different sex residents exhibit different trend in labor force participation rate.


### 5.3 The subtitles are also meant to address the issue of original sketch having generic title
The subtitles are be used to reveal insights directly instead of asking readers to guess.

## **6.0 Proposed Data Visualization**

### 6.1 Data Preparation
*Excel file used here was downloaded from here [https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/LabourForceTimeSeries.aspx]"Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex". Filed was then renamed to Res_LF_PartRate
